# benchmark datasets
The size of HNSCC, PAAD and COAD files exceeds the limit of GitHub upload file size even if they are compressed, so we split the three files to ensure that the files can be uploaded to GitHub.
## multi-source gene expression dataset
The multi-source gene expression dataset is generated by synthesizing HNSCC_sample1, HNSCC_sample2, HNSCC_sample3, HNSCC_sample4, HNSCC_sample5, CHOL_sample, PAAD_sample1, PAAD_sample2, Normal_sample files. gnd4class_4_GAI.csv file is the label information of the multi-source gene expression dataset. The one-hot code of four categories of label information: 1000->0, 0100->1, 0010->2, 0001->3, where 0 represents HNSCC, 1 represents normal, 2 represents CHOL, and 3 represents PAAD.
## COAD dataset
The COAD dataset is generated by synthesizing COAD_sample1, COAD_sample2, COAD_sample3, COAD_sample4 files. COADSampleCategory1.csv file is the label information of the COAD dataset. The one-hot code of two categories of label information: 10->0, 01->1, where 0 represents COAD, 1 represents normal.
